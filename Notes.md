**React uses JSX (JavaScript XML). With JSX, we are able to write HTML like code in JS**.<br>

**React uses virtual DOM. It is a lightweight version of a real DOM. We can keep track of the changes applied to the virtual DOM and only apply those changes to the actual DOM, instead of refreshing the whole page.
This reduces rendering performance overhead**.<br>
